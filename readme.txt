 ConquerSMS is a service  for sending out SMS  (Small Message Service) to  any
 mobile telephone in  Denmark. You cannot  use this in  other countries, since
 the number format of the mobile phone is checked for validity before  sending
 out a message.

 Various features are provided, e.g.  addressbook and possibility to send  out
 multiple messages.
